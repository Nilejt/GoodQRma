                            if physically going somewhere as a team is out of the question, volunteering as a team is still possible – if you’re willing to get creative. for instance, you could split your employees into teams and hold a contest for which team can bring in the most toys or canned goods. at the end of the campaign, hold a short – and fun – meeting to announce the winning team.
